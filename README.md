As part of our team discussion, we found out blood donation is essential to the health and medical progress of every country, specially the developing countries that experience a shortage of suitable blood types and blood donors. Therefore, we found that the path to clinical or medical advancement is to address the issue of blood scarcity or unavailability. We thus made the decision to create a mobile application to solve these difficulties.

As a team, we were inspired to draft a blood bank application during the COVID time. We were in Nepal during the time of COVID-19, and a close friend of ours from our home country resided nearby. He was hospitalized and isolated at the time because of COVID.  His condition wasn't terrific, therefore the doctor instructed his parents to bring the blood (AB+). Finding the right blood was a significant challenge. We, his family, and other friends found it challenging to look for the blood. We were getting blood, but it wasn't the proper blood group. After several failed efforts and a great deal of work, and a lengthy period, we succeeded in getting the blood. We were discussing how to handle this situation once this occurred. That gave us the idea to develop an app that would help both blood donors and receivers. With the use of this app's search function, blood donors may be quickly found. Users of the app may log in and search for nearby blood receivers or donors by inputting their location. Even though it is simple to use, it has the power to save countless lives.

This software is created using the programming language dart, flutter for the front end, and firebase for the back end. We divided our job between ourselves and then worked individually on the front end and back end. The front end first tried to use flutter, however owing to several failures, we had trouble delivering output. Our back end also started off by utilizing Firebase.

The inaccuracy in our project was the hardest part. We first had trouble integrating the front end and back end. Additionally, there were various obstacles and hurdles in developing a user-friendly user interface. We had problems in giving users access to all of the functionalities with just one tap. But in the end, we were able to resolve every issue.

Actually, throughout this hackathon, we learnt and had fun with our project. We developed our ability to work together and communicate with each other. The activity truly appeals to us. In addition to understanding how to implement user authentication, we also learnt how to integrate the Firebase platform with our Flutter apps.

We are quite pleased and delighted with our project. We could have added more features and detailed information to the application if we had more time. Other than that, we are happy and proud of our project.

Built with : Flutter, Firebase, Dart, Google login API, firebase auth and Java.
